# Aether - Project Analysis

Based on reading the actual code, **Aether** (formerly Aether Flow Solver) is an AI-powered strategic advisory platform where a user (referred to as "Boss") can consult with multiple specialized AI personas for mentorship and business guidance.

## What This Project Actually Does

### Core Purpose
A sophisticated chat interface that connects a founder/CEO with AI-powered advisors, each with distinct personalities and expertise areas.

### The Personas
- **Boss** (Red #C53030) - The user themselves
- **Gunnar** (Blue #3B4DE8) - Operational discipline advisor
- **Samara** (Purple #9333EA) - Growth strategy specialist
- **Kirby** (Orange #D97706) - Product development expert
- **Stefan** (Green #059669) - Content and regulatory specialist

### Dual-Call Architecture
The system uses a unique two-call architecture for each conversation:
1. **Primary Response** (Call 1) - Real-time streaming advice from the selected persona
2. **Artisan Cut** (Call 2) - Background extraction that distills each conversation into strategic insights

### Context Loading System
Before responding, the system loads:
- Turn protocol (instructions for handling context)
- Boss profile (user context)
- Selected persona profile
- Past journals (historical conversations)
- Journal entries (conversation history)
- Persistent attachments (knowledge base files)
- Ephemeral attachments (temporary uploads)

### Key Features

#### Multi-Persona Chat System
- User's messages are labeled as coming from "Boss"
- 4 AI Personas the user can select from, each with unique expertise
- Each persona has its own profile loaded from Supabase storage

#### Model Selection
Users can choose from multiple AI models:
- GPT-4o Mini (Fast)
- GPT-4o (Balanced)
- GPT-5 variants (GPT-5-2025-08-07, GPT-5 Mini)
- GPT-4.1-2025-04-14
- O3-2025-04-16 (Reasoning model)

#### File Handling
- Upload files as attachments to messages
- Files can be categorized (persona, boss, journal, general)
- Support for both persistent and ephemeral storage

#### Google Integration
- OAuth2 integration with Google Workspace
- Access to Gmail, Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Drive
- Token storage and management

### Data Persistence
Two main storage mechanisms:
- **superjournal_entries**: Complete conversation history with full responses
- **journal_entries**: Extracted essences from the artisan cut process

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **AI**: OpenAI API integration with streaming support
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage buckets for files and profiles
- **Auth**: Currently requires authentication but has security bypasses
- **Timezone**: Berlin timezone for all timestamps

### User Flow
1. User types a message, optionally selecting a persona
2. System loads all context (boss profile, persona, history, attachments)
3. Sends to OpenAI with streaming response
4. Displays response in real-time with color-coded personas
5. Background process extracts essence for journal
6. All conversations saved to database

### Data Flow
1. User sends message →
2. System loads complete context package →
3. OpenAI streams response with persona personality →
4. Response saved to superjournal →
5. Background process extracts essence to journal

The platform essentially creates a personalized board of advisors powered by AI, with each persona maintaining consistent personality and expertise while having access to the full context of the user's journey and business.

## Security Notes
- Hardcoded Supabase credentials in the codebase
- Authentication bypassed with public access
- All data publicly accessible without auth checks
- API keys exposed in frontend code

## Code Quality Issues Identified
- 73 linting errors (56 errors, 17 warnings)
- Excessive use of `any` types
- No React optimization (no memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- 255+ console.log statements in production
- Silent error failures throughout
- Missing error boundaries
