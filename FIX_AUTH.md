# Authentication Fix - v4

## The Problem
Your app was bypassing login because of stale/invalid sessions in localStorage that weren't being validated.

## What This Fix Does
1. **Validates sessions** - Double-checks with Supabase that sessions are real
2. **Clears invalid sessions** - Auto-signs out if session is fake/expired
3. **Requires real auth** - No more phantom users or fake login states
4. **Fixes infrastructure** - Database table, OAuth URLs, Vercel routing

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clear Your Browser Completely
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
// Then hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
```

### 2. Create Missing Database Table (if needed)
Run `fix-database.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### 3. Deploy
```bash
git push origin fix-missing-login-v4
vercel --prod
```

## How to Test
1. Visit https://aether.deepakpatnaik.com
2. You should see the login page (not chat)
3. Login with Google
4. Should redirect to chat with your messages

## What Changed
- `AuthContext.tsx` - Validates sessions with `getUser()` call
- `supabase/client.ts` - Added PKCE flow for better security
- `useChat.ts` - Added logging to track auth state
- `vercel.json` - Fixes 404 on refresh
- OAuth URLs - Points to your domain

## If Still Broken
Check browser console for these logs:
- "Auth event: ..." - Shows auth state changes
- "Invalid session detected" - Means old session was cleared
- "Loading data for authenticated user" - Means auth worked

If you see "Invalid session detected", that's GOOD - it means the fix is working and clearing bad sessions.
