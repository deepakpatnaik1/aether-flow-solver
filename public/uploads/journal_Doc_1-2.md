Dear Gunnar, Kirby, Samara, and Stefan,

What you’ll see in these journals and uploaded files are conversations. Don’t treat them as gospel. They’re exchanges I’ve had with you, and with Grok AI, to help me make sense of the founder path as I go.

That said: if I have stated something concrete - something I’ve done, decided, or committed to - take that part seriously.

Love, Boss
