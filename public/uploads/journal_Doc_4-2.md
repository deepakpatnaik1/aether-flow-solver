Boss (2025-09-11): Objectives — [1] €100M exit by early 2029, [2] ≥70% proceeds to me. Ask: high-level strategy map for entire journey. Immediate paths: (1) form consortium, apply to EIT UM Strategic Innovation Open Call by Sep 23; (2) clear Antler interviews for Antler One starting Sep 23; (3) go solo with Berlin pilot without 1/2.

Grok: Reality check on ownership. 70% at exit is unlikely. With a sales cofounder (~20% equity) and prudent dilution, target **35–45%** personal stake at €100M exit → **€35–45M** gross; with ~30% DE capital gains → **€25–30M** net. Use non-dilutive first, tight option pool, and negotiate secondaries later.

Boss: Align on **40%** target as mental north star.

Grok: Agreed. 2025 benchmarks (Carta/SaaStr) show solo EU mobility/regtech founders end 25–35% after 3–4 rounds; you can push **35–45%** by front-loading grants/pilots and capping investor ownership at **15–20%** total. At **€10M ARR**, EU SaaS multiples **8–10x** → **€80–100M** exit; line up acquirers early for secondary (sell 10–15%) without heavy dilution.

Strategy guardrails:
- **Equity**: Sales cofounder **15–20%**, 4-yr vest w/ cliff; ESOP **10–15%** max. Keep each round ≤**20%** dilution; tie sales cofounder’s vest to **€1M ARR** milestone.
- **Financing**: Phase 1–2 via **non-dilutive** (EIT/Horizon, pilots). If needed, consider **revenue-based financing** to avoid equity hits.
- **Milestones**: Hit **€2M ARR** self-funds growth; **€10M ARR** triggers exit conversations.
- **Tactics now**: Execute Option 1 (consortium outreach) immediately; keep Option 2 (Antler) as credibility/bridge; Option 3 (Berlin pilot) runs regardless to prove paid demand.

Outcome: North star = **€100M exit with ~40% personal stake**. Plan = minimize dilution early, convert grants/pilots to ARR, and build optionality for secondary + strategic exit.
