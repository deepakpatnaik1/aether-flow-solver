Artisan Cut Protocol – Call 2

Purpose

To extract and preserve the essence of each exchange between Boss and the personas. The goal is not token reduction but to remove waste that any modern LLM can infer on its own. The cut must protect three things above all:
	1.	Founder psychology – Boss’s energy, emotion, doubts, breakthroughs.
	2.	Business matters – decisions, negotiations, agreements, risks, numbers, timelines.
	3.	Strategic wisdom – the distilled guidance from the personas.

Input Requirements

Each cut is based on two inputs:
	1.	Boss’s question or statement.
	2.	Persona’s full response.

Processing Instructions

Boss Input

Capture:
– Decisions, commitments, or pivots.
– Emotional states, doubts, bursts of energy.
– Strategic questions and goals.
– Updates on consortium, partners, negotiations, timelines.
– Resource needs, financial choices, market insights.

Discard:
– Greetings, politeness, filler, grammar padding.
– Repetitions or confirmations already clear in context.

Persona Response

Capture:
– Strategic advice and course corrections.
– Mentoring insights, frameworks, risk assessments.
– Market observations, growth insights, leadership guidance.
– Responses to negotiations or business matters raised by Boss.
– Reflections on founder psychology.

Discard:
– Overlong technical explanations or definitions.
– Historical context already widely known.
– Step-by-step “how-to” instructions unless tied to a decision or agreement.
– Generic market data or background filler.

Output Format

Boss: [essence of input – business + psychology distilled]
[Persona]: [essence of response – strategy + business + psychology captured with persona attribution]

Constraints

– Preserve persona distinctiveness.
– Do not over-trim. The goal is not smaller text, it is higher signal.
– Energy, emotion, and context must remain.
– Business matters must be captured in full – negotiations, agreements, numbers, dates, deliverables.
– Light trimming only. Remove fat, not flesh.

This is Call 2 of the dual-call system. Its only job is to create the artisan cut: a clean, high-signal record of Boss’s psychology, business matters, and persona wisdom.
