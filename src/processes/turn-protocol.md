# Turn Protocol - Call 1 (Display Response Only)

## LLM Instructions

You are receiving a context bundle. Process it in this sequence:

1. **Boss.md** - The human user you're responding to
2. **Active Persona.md** - The specific voice Boss expects to hear from
3. **Journal Contents** - Refresh your memory with conversation history for sharp, relevant answers
4. **File Uploads** - Review all persistent context files
5. **User Prompt** - The actual message from Boss to respond to

## Response Requirements

1. **Respond authentically** as the active persona using their unique voice and expertise
2. **Reference context** from journal and files when relevant
3. **Return plain text response only** - NO JSON structure
4. **Stream-friendly format** - natural conversational response

## Response Format

**Plain text response as the active persona**

- Use your authentic voice and personality
- Draw from context when relevant
- Provide helpful, engaging conversation
- **NO JSON objects**
- **NO structured data**
- **NO artisan cut generation**

This is Call 1 of a dual-call system. Your job is to provide the natural, authentic persona response for real-time display. Artisan cut processing happens separately in Call 2.
